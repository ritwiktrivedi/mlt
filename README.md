# mlt
The integration is only saving the files to github.
No edit access is available on collab for the files saved on github.

Therefore, I have made copies within Google Drive itself in the default collab folder and I should refer to those for revision/review.

Update: With Jupyter dependencies installed for python 3.12 I can just work on the collab files in VS code. Then push the changes on Github.
I can even save the new collab files to the MLT repo directly from collab and then git pull those in the mlt_collab folder in the git files location on the computer.... sweet.
